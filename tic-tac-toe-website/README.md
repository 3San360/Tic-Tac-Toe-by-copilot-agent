## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
